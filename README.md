# Instruction for 2019 IOT and AI for Engineers workshop

In this workshop, we use Raspberry Pi with a PIR sensor, Pi Camera, and TensorFlow model to create IoT image recognition system. 

We use Python to control GPIO that connects a motion sensor (PIR sensor) and a camera module (Pi Camera). 

Instead of training our neural network from scratch, we will use the pre-trained model and Transfer Learning technique to train a custom model quickly.

Image recognition is handled by TensorFlow.

## Prerequisites

The TensorFlow announced official support for Raspberry Pi, from Version 1.9 it will support Raspberry Pi using pip package installation. We will see how to install it on our Raspberry Pi in this tutorial.

* Raspberry Pi
* Minimum 16GB SD Card
* Raspberry Pi Camera Modoule
* a PIR sensor Module
* Electronic Components
  * Jumpers
  * (Optionally) Breadboard
* Raspbian 9 (Stretch)
* Python 3.4 
* Tensorflow

## Assembling your Pi

ABSOLUTELY, DO NOT POWER UP YOUR PI DURING THIS SECTION.

1. Connect Pi Camera to serial interface.

2. Using jumper cables, connect a PIR sensor to GPIO pins. Make sure that you follow the diagram accordingly. 

    ![Wiring a PIR sensor](/figures/pir_wiring.png)

    There are three pins on the PIR; they should be labeled Vcc, GND, and Out. If these labels arenâ€™t clear, they are sometimes concealed beneath the Fresnel lens (the white cap), which you can temporarily remove to see the pin labels.

    1. The Vcc pin needs attaching to a **5V** pin on the Raspberry Pi.
    2. The GND pin on the PIR sensor can be attached to any ground pin on the Raspberry Pi.
    3. Lastly, the Out pin needs to be connected to **GPIO4**.

## Install Raspbian 9 and essential packages

We have to install Raspbian 9 (Stretch) and set up a working environment. 

1. Insert the prepared SD card to your Raspberry Pi and connect a power supply to turn it on.

2. Install Raspbian 9 with [NOOBS Installer](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/) downloaded from the official website. 

3. When the installation finish, you'll arrive at the desktop. Open the terminal.
   
4. Update your Pi and its packages. Using the following commands.

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt upgrade

5. Ensure that you have the latest Python version, using the following command. 

        python3 --version

    At least Python 3.4 is recommended.

6. Install *libatlas* library. Which is required by Tensorflow.

        sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev

7. Install TensorFlow using Pip3.

        pip3 install tensorflow

## Setup your IoT Image Recognition System

1. Download [the project repository from GitHub](https://github.com/boonitis/2019-iot-ai-workshop), or clone it using the command. 

        git clone https://github.com/boonitis/2019-iot-ai-workshop.git

2. In the terminal, go to the downloaded directory.

        cd /home/pi/2019-iot-ai-workshop/

3. Run the following command test the motion sensor.

        python3 test/motion.py

4. Run the following command to test the camera module.

        python3 test/camera.py

5. Run this command to test the model prediction.

        python3 test/recognition.py test.jpg

    You can try this command on other images to see different results.

        python3 test/recognition.py [path/to/image]

6. Finally, run the image recognition system using this command.

        python3 run.py
    
    Check the results.

## Train your own custom model

To train a custom model, first of all, you need training data. Go to [this link ](https://github.com/boonitis/2019-iot-ai-workshop) and click on **DOWNLOAD TRAINING DATA**. (NOTED: During the workshop session, the training data are already provided at */home/pi/2019-iot-ai-workshop/dataset*)

Using pre-trained MobileNet and Transfer Learning, we can train a new custom model very quickly.

1. Extract the downloaded file to */home/pi/2019-iot-ai-workshop/dataset*. Go to the project directory.

        cd /home/pi/2019-iot-ai-workshop/
        ls
   
2. Each directory in *dataset/* is a target class and should contain related images. For example *dataset/dog/* is for *dog* class and it should contain only dog images. Try listing every directory using this command.

        ls dataset/

3. To create your custom model, move any directory you want to use as a target class in the custom model to *training/*. For example, this command moves all *dog* images to training directory.

        mv dataset/dog training/

4. To train a custom model, you can use a provided script.

        python3 train.py training/

    This command will use training data in *training/* to train a model.

5. The training output will be available at *models/*

6. Using an IDE, open *train.py* and modify its *PARAMETERS* to train a different type of model. Remember that you can test the model with this command.

        python3 test/recognition

    Experiment with different parameters to achieve the best possible model!
